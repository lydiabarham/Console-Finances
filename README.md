# Console-Finances
Repository containing code for analysing the financial records of a company

# Description

This M4 Challenge site uses JavaScript to explore and analyse financial data given in a multidimensional array. The console displays five different figures extrapolated from the data using JavaScript code algorithms. The five figures show:
- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
- The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

# Usage

To use the site, open the console to inspect the figures.
